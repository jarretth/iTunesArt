iTunesArt
=========

Script to display current album art on your background

Use:
Add the following line to your crontab
`* * * * * <path_to_script>/iTunesArt.sh`


Right now it needs some editing to probably do what you want. Line 3 has the default desktop(When no music is playing). Right now it assumes the display is 1080 and puts it on the second monitor.
